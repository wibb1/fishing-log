Several double hookups on a single troll.  Perfect eating size too, about 15-20 inches.  We had a blast trolling light tackle, tried casting for them but they seemed to be spread out along the shore.  Not sure what they were after but it is a spot to go back to.")

This is one of 5 or 6 spots.  We caught some small sea bass but were really after fluke and the sea bass were all small.  Maybe next time.
